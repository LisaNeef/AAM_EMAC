This repository holds codes and other materials around a short  project that compared fluctations in the atmospheric angular momentum between climate model simulations and reanalyses. It culminated in the study Neef, L. J., and K. Matthes (2012), Comparison of Earth rotation excitation in data-constrained and unconstrained atmosphere models, _Journal of Geophysical Research_, 117 (D2), D02,107, doi:10.1029/2011JD016555.
